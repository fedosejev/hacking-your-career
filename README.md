## Why LinkedIn?

+ Learning and practicing web and mobile development is _not_ enough.
+ You need to know how to tell the world that you have your skills for sale.
+ When you build your LinkedIn profile you need to think how __your customers__ would see your profile.
+ See yourself as a brand.
+ What your customers care about?

Example: [Artemij's LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/artemij)

Google your full name - the __top 3__ results should be:

2. Your LinkedIn.
3. Your GitHub.

Make your Facebook account __private__, _unless_ you're using it to market your services.
